</td><th>Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘humanity to others’. It also means ‘I am what I am because of who we all are’. The Ubuntu operating system brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the world of computers.The first official Ubuntu release — Version 4.10, codenamed the ‘Warty Warthog’ — was launched in October 2004, and sparked dramatic global interest as thousands of free software enthusiasts and experts joined the Ubuntu community.

The governance of Ubuntu is somewhat independent of Canonical, with volunteer leaders from around the world taking responsibility for many critical elements of the project. It remains a key tenet of the Ubuntu Project that Ubuntu is a shared work between Canonical, other companies, and the thousands of volunteers who bring their expertise to bear on making it a world-class platform for anyone to use.Ubuntu today has nine flavours and dozens of localised and specialised derivatives. There are also special editions for servers, OpenStack clouds, and mobile devices. All editions share common infrastructure and software, making Ubuntu a unique single platform that scales from consumer electronics to the desktop and up into the cloud for enterprise computing.

The Ubuntu OS and the innovative Ubuntu for Android convergence solution make it an exciting time for Ubuntu on mobile devices. In the cloud, Ubuntu is the reference operating system for the OpenStack project, it’s a hugely popular guest OSon Amazon’s EC2 and Rackspace’s Cloud, and it’s pre-installed on computers from Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo and other global vendors. And thanks to that shared infrastructure, developers can work on the desktop, and smoothly delivercode to cloud servers running the stripped-down Ubuntu Server Edition.

After many years Ubuntu still is and always will be free to use, share and develop. We hope it will bring a touch of light to your computing — and we hope that you’ll join us in helping to build the next version.</th></tr>

</td><th>You should back up your system before installation; you can use Time Machine.
Do not interrupt the installation process once you have started to update your system. You may experience unexpected results if you have third-party system software modiﬁcations installed, or if you've modiﬁed the operating system through other means. Choose Software Update from the Apple  menu to check for the latest Apple software via the Internet, including this update.
Other software updates available for your computer may appear, which you should install. Note that an update's size may vary from computer to computer when installed using Software Update. Also, some updates must be installed prior to others, so you should run Software Update until Software Updates states "Your software is up to date".
You can manually download the update installer. This is a useful option when you need to update multiple computers but only want to download the update once. These versions of the standalone installers are available from Apple Support Downloads.</th></tr>
